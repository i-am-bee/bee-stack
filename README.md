# Bee stack

This repository will help you run the entire bee application stack locally
through **docker compose**. This includes the following bee components along with the
supporting infrastructure:

- [bee-agent-framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework)
- [bee-code-interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter)
- [bee-api](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-api)
- [bee-ui](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-ui)
- [bee-observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe)
  and [bee-observe-connector](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe-connector)

## Pre-requisities üîß

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** or similar container engine including docker
compose ([Rancher desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/))
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: A **rootless machine is not supported** (e.g. if you use podman,
> [set your VM to rootful](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-machine-set.1.html#examples))

## Usage üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack.git
cd bee-stack
```

2. Configure environment and fill required variables

```shell
cp example.env .env
vim .env # fill in your API key
```

3. Up! (this might take a while the first time you run it)

```shell
docker compose --profile all up -d
```

Once started you can find use the following URLs:

- bee-ui: http://localhost:3000
- mlflow: http://localhost:15000
- bee-api: http://localhost:4000 (for direct use of the api, use apiKey `sk-testkey`)
- list all open ports: `docker compose ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}"`

You can use any typical compose commands to inspect the state of the services:

```shell
docker compose ps
docker compose logs bee-api
```

Stopping services:

```shell
# Stop all
docker compose --profile all down

# Stop all and remove data
docker compose --profile all down --volumes
```

## Advanced üë∑

If you are a developer on `bee-api` or `bee-ui` and want to run only the supporting infrastructure,
use the profile `infra`, e.g.:

```shell
docker compose --profile infra up -d
```
