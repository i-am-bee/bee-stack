![Bee Stack Demo Video](./docs/assets/bee-stack-demo.gif)

The Bee Stack repository provides everything you need to run the Bee Application Stack locally using **Docker Compose**. This setup allows you to run, test, and experiment with Bee's various components seamlessly.

## üß© Bee Stack Components

The Bee Stack comprises the following components, each contributing distinct functionalities to support your AI-driven applications:

- [bee-agent-framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework) gives the foundation to build LLM Agents.
- [bee-code-interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter) runs a user or generated Python code in a sandboxed environment.
- [bee-api](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-api) exposes agents via OpenAPI compatible Rest API.
- [bee-ui](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-ui) allows you to create agents within your web browser.
- [bee-observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe) and [bee-observe-connector](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe-connector) help you to trace what you are agents are doing.

## üîß Pre-requisities

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** or similar container engine including docker
compose ([Rancher desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/))
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: A **rootless machine is not supported** (e.g. if you use podman,
> [set your VM to rootful](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-machine-set.1.html#examples))

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1. Clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack.git
cd bee-stack
```

2. Configure environment and fill required variables

```shell
cp example.env .env
vim .env # fill in your API key
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If you change providers, the default bee will stop working, because it is configured with a model from the previous provider. You should create a new Bee or remove all data using `docker compose --profile all down --volumes`.

3. Up! (this might take a while the first time you run it)

```shell
docker compose --profile all up -d
```

Once started you can find use the following URLs:

- bee-ui: http://localhost:3000
- mlflow: http://localhost:8080
- bee-api: http://localhost:4000 (for direct use of the api, use apiKey `sk-testkey`)
- list all open ports: `docker compose ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}"`

You can use any typical compose commands to inspect the state of the services:

```shell
docker compose ps
docker compose logs bee-api
```

Stopping services:

```shell
# Stop all
docker compose --profile all down

# Stop all and remove data
docker compose --profile all down --volumes
```

## üë∑ Advanced

If you are a developer on `bee-api` or `bee-ui` and want to run only the supporting infrastructure,
use the profile `infra`, e.g.:

```shell
docker compose --profile infra up -d
```
